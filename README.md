# Midjourney-prompt-generator
The Art Prompt Generator has a simple form that collects user inputs about various aspects of the midjourney prompt, such as objects, lighting, style, color, medium, size, and aspect ratio. The form is followed by a "Generate Prompt" button that, when clicked, generates a prompt based on the user's inputs.
